Complete multi layer perceptron project writen by using numpy for calculations. I add a lot functionality to this project and make it well commented for make understandable to people who new to this area.
This project using fashion-mnist dataset original here https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.git. But I use csv converted version in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist.
In this project you able to;
- Change input, hidden, output layer process elements according to your model needs
- Can read and contuine training from pre_trained weight
- Can save weigths setted period of time
- Can chose different activation functions independently for both input-hidden and hidden-output parts
- Can use dropout and noise functions to prevent overfitting
- Can see success rate as confussion matrix
- Can see Mean Squared Error (MSE) graph for getting general idea of models training process
- Can show how much time should needed for training the model

There is a lot functionallity in this project but a lot of think could be added such as;
- Different model evaluation metrics than Mean Squared Error,
- Different regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization
- Implement batch training to update weights using mini-batches instead of updating after each record.
and so on.
